# Reading 'Crafting Interpreters'

Notes will go here in this Readme until I need more pages for clarity

## Languages

I'm following along with the book, so I'll do the implementations in Java and C. 

I'm also practicing Rust, and want to practice my translation skills, so I'll do the Java and C implementations in Rust too.

## Challenges

### introduction

1. There are at least six domain-specific languages used in the little system I cobbled together to write and publish this book. What are they?

2. Get a “Hello, world!” program written and running in Java. Set up whatever Makefiles or IDE projects you need to get it working. If you have a debugger, get comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.

3. Do the same thing for C. To get some practice with pointers, define a doubly-linked list of heap-allocated strings. Write functions to insert, find, and delete items from it. Test them.
